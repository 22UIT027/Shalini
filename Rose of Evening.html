The main character, Aduan, is drowned and resurfaces to find a hidden world in the Yellow River, where he falls in love with a girl, who he met, dancing in the festival of the Dragon Junk.They get separated by the Dragon Prince and the girl crumbles under the separation and commits suicide. The lovers both commit suicide only to find themselves as departed spirits in Aduan's home town.<br>

The Rose of Evening is more of a traditional love story than a fairy tale and does not follow the hero's journey closely. The characters face less physical tests and undergo different emotional changes.</p>
